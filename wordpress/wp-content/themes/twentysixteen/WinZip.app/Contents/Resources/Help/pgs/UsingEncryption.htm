  <h1>Encrypting for Security</h1><i>The encryption facility provided by this version of WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>
  is identical to the AES encryption provided by the Windows version of WinZip 9 or later.</i>

  <p>To encrypt your files as they are zipped</p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>When <a href="AddToZipFile.htm">adding files to an open Zip file</a>, check the
    <b>Encrypt</b> option in the <b>Add</b> dialog box.</li>

    <li>When <a href="UsingDockIcon.htm">dropping files on the Dock</a> using the WinZip icon,
    check the <b>Encrypt</b> option in the <b>Dragged Files</b> dialog box.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In all the above cases, once you have checked the Encrypt option, enter your password. Enter
  the password a second time to verify that there are no typos.</p>

 <h3>Notes on using encryption</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>When opened in WinZip, the main WinZip window marks encrypted files with an overlay
    icon or mark in the encryption column.</li>

    <li>The quality of the passwords you choose can greatly affect the security of your encrypted
    documents. Please read about <a href="EncryptionPasswords.htm">passwords</a>.</li>

    <li>Be sure to keep track of your passwords! You will not be able to unzip, view, or open any files
    for which you do not have the correct password.</li>

    <li>When sending Zip files as attachments, please be sure to use a safe and secure method to
    notify the e-mail recipient of the required password.</li>
  </ul>
