  <h1>Working With Files in the WinZip Window</h1>

  <p>The WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> window makes it possible to add to a Zip file, unzip files
  from a Zip file, view the content of a Zip file and the content of files inside the Zip file, and
  to delete files from the Zip file. The WinZip window is made up of the viewing area and 5
  optional bars, called the <a href="Tool%20Bar.htm">Toolbar</a>, the <a href="Zip%20Bar.htm">Zip
  bar</a>, and the <a href="Status%20Bar.htm">Status
  bar</a>. The viewing area displays the content of the Zip file using any of 5 different views:
  <a href="#IconView">icon</a>, <a href="#ListView">list</a>, <a href="#ColumnView">column</a>,
  <a href="#CoverFlowView">cover flow</a>, and <a href="#FlatView">flat</a>.</p>

  <h6><a name="IconView" id="IconView"></a>Icon View</h6>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Selected%20View-Icon.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>In Icon view, each file or folder in the Zip file is displayed as an icon with the file or
  folders name under the icon. When possible, the same icon appears for a file as the icon that
  would appear for that file in Finder.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Main%20Window%20-%20Icon.png" alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Encryption Overlay</b>: an encryption overlay icon will appear in the
    lower left corner of a file's icon to indicate that the file is encrypted.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h6><a name="ListView" id="ListView"></a>List View</h6>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Selected%20View-List.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>List view is the default view. The content is
  displayed as a list of files and folders along with information about each file or folder such as
  the date the original was modified, the size of the file zipped and unzipped, the kind of file,
  and whether or not the file is encrypted. The information is organized into columns and by
  clicking on a columns header can be sorted relative to the information in that column.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Main%20Window%20-%20List.png" alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Column Headers</b>: each column contains a certain type of information
    about the file in the corresponding row. The header provides a description of the type of
    information in that column. Clicking on the header sorts the list according to the information
    in the column. To toggle between ascending and descending order (a-z, z-a), re-click on the
    same column header.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Folders</b>: Zip files can contain information about the folders from
    which the files came. This information is displayed as folders in the list view. The folder is
    normally displayed as closed. Double clicking on the folder opens the folder to show only that
    folder's content. Clicking on the disclosure arrow, displays the content of the folder and any
    subitems (folders and files) it contains.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Files</b>: files in the Zip file can be unzipped, opened, viewed,
    deleted, and dragged out of the Zip file and dropped. Files can be added to the Zip file and
    dragged and dropped into the Zip file.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Encryption Overlay</b>: an encryption overlay icon will appear on the
    left edge of the first column to indicate that the file is encrypted.</li>
  </ol>

  <h6><a name="ColumnView" id="ColumnView"></a>Column View</h6>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Selected%20View-Column.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>The column view works like the column view in Finder. Each column displays the content of the
  selected item in the preceding column.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Main%20Window%20-%20Column.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Column Size Adjustment</b>: the width of a column can be adjusted by
    dragging the <b>gripper</b> left or right.</li>
  </ol>

  <h6><a name="CoverFlowView" id="CoverFlowView"></a>Cover Flow View</h6>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Selected%20View-CoverFlow.png" alt=""></p>

  <p>This view allows the
  content of files in the Zip file to be previewed along with displaying information about the
  files in the Zip file.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Main%20Window%20-%20CoverFlow.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Browsing</b>: scrolling left or right with the <b>scroll bar</b> or using
    the <b>arrow keys</b> displays previews of the previous and next files.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Sizing</b>: drag the <b>scroll bar</b> up or down to change the size of the preview and list panes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h6><a name="FlatView" id="FlatView"></a>Flat View</h6>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Selected%20View-Flat.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>The flat view works like the column view in Finder with a Path column. Each column displays the content of the selected item in the preceding column.</p>
