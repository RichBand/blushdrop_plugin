  <h1>The Quick Start Guide</h1>

  <p>This Guide introduces some file compression terms and provides a first look at using some
  WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> features. For additional information see the WinZip help file, and the
  <a href="http://www.winzip.com/wzgate.cgi?lang=EN&prod=WM&url=www.winzip.com" target="_blank">WinZip
  web site</a>.</p>

  <h6>What is a Zip File, Anyway?</h6>

  <p>Zip files are files used for storing and distributing files, and can contain one or more
  files. Usually the files "zipped" in a Zip file are compressed to save space. Zip files typically
  have an extension of <i>.zip</i> or <i>.zipx</i>. Zip files are often used to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Distribute files on the Internet</b>: only one Zip file transfer operation (download) is
    required to obtain all related files, and file transfer is quicker because the zipped files are
    compressed.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Send a group of related files to an associate</b>: when you distribute the collection of
    files as a Zip file, you benefit from the file grouping and compression as well.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Save disk space</b>: if you have large files that are important but seldom used, such as
    large data files, simply zip these files into a Zip file and then unzip them only when
    needed.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Share files over the Internet</b>: zip files and upload to a cloud service, 
    then share the Zip via social media, Messages or Mail. </li>
  </ul>

 <h6>What Does WinZip Do?</H6>

  <p>WinZip makes it easy for Mac users to work with Zip files. WinZip features an
  intuitive point-and-click drag-and-drop interface for viewing, running, unzipping, adding to, and
  deleting files in Zip files with a standard Mac interface.</p>

  <h6>About WinZip's First Run Options</h6>

  <p>During the first run of WinZip you are asked whether you would like WinZip to copy the
  application into your application folder and whether you want WinZip to always appear on your
  Dock.</p>

  <h6>Using WinZip</h6>

  <p>With its Finder-like interface, the WinZip interface is quite powerful yet easy to use,
  once the basics of Zip files are understood. In the following sections we will describe the
  WinZip interface and provide a brief introduction to some of the features of WinZip.</p>

<h3>Quick Zipping with WinZip</h3>

    <li>When WinZip starts, a new "Untitled.zip" Zip file is created automatically in a temporary location.  If WinZip is already running, to create a new Zip file, in the WinZip window choose <b>New Zip File</b> from the <a href=
    "Menu%20Bar%20-%20File.htm">File</a></b> menu. The new "Untitled.zip" Zip File window will appear.</li></li>

    <li>To add (<i>zip</i>) items to the Zip file, click the <b>Add</b> and select a location on the <a href="Tool Bar.htm">toolbar</a> or choose
    <b>Add from My Mac</b> or <b>Add from Cloud</b> from the <a href="Menu Bar - Actions.htm">Actions</a> menu. The Add sheet will appear.</li>

    <li>In the Open window, select the Zip file you want to unzip, then click
    <b>Open</b>. The contents of the Zip file will be displayed in the WinZip window.</li>
