  <p>This registered version license is for users who have obtained from WinZip Computing a valid

  <h2>WinZip License<br>
  Registered Version</h2>

  <h3 class="c1">Your Agreement to this License</h3>

  <p>This License only applies to the executable code for the English-language version of any
  edition of WinZip 4 software and any accompanying distributable files, data and
  materials ("WinZip"). You should carefully read the following terms and conditions
  before using, installing, copying, or distributing WinZip. Unless otherwise agreed in
  a writing signed by an authorized representative of WinZip Computing, S.L. ("WinZip Computing"),
  your use, installation, copying, or distribution of WinZip indicates your acceptance
  of this agreement ("License"). You understand and agree that the terms and conditions of this
  License are the only terms and conditions applicable to your purchase of this License or use of
  WinZip and any additional or different terms specified, referenced, and/or
  incorporated by any document provided by you or on your behalf are hereby rejected by WinZip
  Computing.</p>

  <p>The WinZip software features you are licensed to use will depend on the
  registration code you have been issued which is issued based on the version of WinZip
  you have licensed. Refer to the documentation provided with your license which specifies your
  licensed version of WinZip. For a complete description of the features available with
  each version of WinZip, refer to <a href=
  "http://www.winzip.com/wzgate.cgi?lang=EN&prod=WM&url=www.winzip.com" target=
  "_blank">www.winzip.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Please read the license terms below. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of
  this License, then do not use, install, copy, or distribute WinZip. In addition, if
  you paid a license fee to WinZip Computing or an authorized WinZip Computing reseller, you may
  return to WinZip Computing or the reseller, as applicable, a copy of the registration code,
  registration file, or activation code, if any, and a signed Affidavit of De-Installation and
  Non-Use in the form set forth on the winzip.com website, within thirty (30) days after purchase,
  for a full refund of the license fee.</p>

  <p>The terms and conditions of this License describe the permitted use and user(s) of each copy
  for which you have paid a license fee or acquired by purchasing qualifying hardware ("Licensed
  Copy") of WinZip.</p>

  <h3 class="c1">Scope of License</h3>

  <p>Subject to the terms of this License, WinZip Computing grants to you, for each Licensed Copy,
  a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, license to install and use WinZip, 
  solely for your personal or internal business purposes.</p>

  <p>If you have received a WinZip OEM License you are deemed to have a single Licensed
  Copy of WinZip and you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip
  on the hardware with which you received WinZip. If you have paid for a WinZip
  single-user license and received a valid Registration Code, you are deemed to have a
  single Licensed Copy of WinZip and you have the right to install and use a single
  copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for non-simultaneous use by one or more
  persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for
  the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip.
  If you have paid for a multi-user license and received a valid Registration File or Code, you or
  your organization are deemed to have acquired the number of Licensed Copies as indicated in the
  documents issued by WinZip Computing and you have the right to install or access a copy of your
  licensed version of WinZip on multiple computers up to the number of Licensed Copies
  that you have acquired.</p>

  <p>You may not give, transfer or sell copies of WinZip to your customer(s), or any
  third party, in whole or in part, nor include copies of WinZip, in whole or in part,
  in, or with, products you sell.</p>

  <p>Each Licensed Copy may be accessed through a network, provided that you have purchased a
  Licensed Copy for each workstation that will access WinZip through the network. For
  instance, if 8 different workstations will access WinZip on the network, you must purchase 8
  Licensed Copies of WinZip, regardless of whether the 8 workstations will access
  WinZip at different times, or concurrently.</p>

  <p>All rights of any kind in WinZip which are not expressly granted in this License
  are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by WinZip Computing. WinZip is protected
  by the United States copyright laws and other applicable national and international laws and
  treaties.</p>

  <p>You may use, install and distribute WinZip solely as expressly provided in this
  License. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, modify, translate, reverse engineer,
  decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on, WinZip, in whole or in
  part, nor permit anyone else to do so. You may not make access to WinZip available to
  others in connection with a service bureau, application service provider, or similar business,
  nor permit anyone else to do so. The license granted hereunder includes no rights in or to the
  source code version of WinZip.</p>

  all use of the copies of WinZip covered by this License. <b><i>This disclaimer of
  warranty constitutes an essential part of this License.</i></b></p>

  <p class="c2">Except to the extent expressly prohibited by applicable statutes, WinZip Computing,
  its affiliates or licensors shall not be liable for any damage or financial loss arising out of

  <p class="c2">In addition, in no event does WinZip Computing authorize you or anyone else to use
  WinZip in applications or systems where WinZip's failure to perform can

  loss of life. Any such use is entirely at your own risk, and you agree to hold WinZip Computing,
  its affiliates or licensors harmless from any and all claims or losses relating to such
  unauthorized use.</p>
