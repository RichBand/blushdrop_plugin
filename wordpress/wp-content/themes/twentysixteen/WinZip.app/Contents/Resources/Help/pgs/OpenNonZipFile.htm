  <h1>Opening a File Inside a Zip File</h1>

  <p>It is not necessary to unzip a file before you can open it. WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> provides the
  ability to open the file directly from an open Zip file within WinZip. There are three ways
  you can accomplish this.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Double Click</b>: in the open Zip file, locate the file you want to open.
    Double click on the file. The file will open up in the associated program as if you had
    double clicked on the file in Finder.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Open</b>: in the open Zip file, locate the file you want to open. Select
    <b>Open <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></b> from the <a href="Menu%20Bar%20-%20File.htm">File</a>
    menu. The file will open up in the associated program as if you had selected open for the file
    in Finder.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Open With</b>: in the open Zip file, locate the file you want to open.
    From the <a href="Menu%20Bar%20-%20File.htm">File</a> menu, select <b>Open With</b> and then
    an alternate program from the list of possible programs. The file will be opened by the
    selected program.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The open file is a temporary copy and will be deleted by WinZip
  when you close the Zip file.  If you've made changes to the open file
  and wish to save the changes, you will need to save the changed file
  before you close the Zip file.</p>
