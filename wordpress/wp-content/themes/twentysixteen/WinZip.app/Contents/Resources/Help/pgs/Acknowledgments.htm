  <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

  <p>WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> incorporates compression code by the Info-ZIP group, which is used with
  their permission. Special thanks to the entire Info-ZIP group, in particular to Jean-loup Gailly,
  Greg Roelofs, and Mark Adler. The original Info-ZIP sources are freely available by anonymous
  ftp.</p>

  <p>WinZip uses AES encryption and decryption routines written by Dr. Brian Gladman. The
  source code for these routines is available to any interested party under an open source BSD or
  GPL license from Dr. Gladman's web site. This is the same AES code that is incorporated into
  WinZip for the Windows PC. WinZip Computing would like to express its appreciation to Dr. Gladman
  for making this code available.</p>

  <p>Our thanks go to Dmitry Shkarin for sharing his variation of the PPM algorithm with the world
  and to Dmitry Subbotin for placing his "carryless rangecoder" into the public domain.</p>

  <p>We thank David Bryant for his open source contribution of the WAVPACK compression
  technology.</p>
