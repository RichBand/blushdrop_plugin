  <h1>Unzipping Selected Files</h1>

  <p>To unzip files from within WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>, you need to <a href="OpenZipFile.htm">open the
  Zip file</a>. The simplest method for unzipping selected files is to drag them out of the WinZip
  Mac window and drop them onto the desktop or into a folder in the Finder window. Alternatively,
  to unzip selected files in the open Zip file, select the files to be unzipped, then click on 
  <b>Unzip</b> on the <a href=  "Tool%20Bar.htm">toolbar</a> and select a destination or click 
  on <b>Unzip to My Mac</b> or <b>Unzip to Cloud</b> (and select a destination) from the 
  <a href=  "Menu%20Bar%20-%20Actions.htm">Actions</a> menu.</p>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Unzip Sheet</b>: when the <b>Unzip</b> icon or menu item is selected, the Unzip
    sheet slides down from the WinZip toolbar. You can select the options and destination for
    the unzipped files. Once the options have been set, click <b>Unzip</b> to unzip the files to
    the designated location.</li>

    <li class="UnzipSaveAs"><b class="Bullet">Save As</b>: when a single file is being unzipped, the name of the file
    is shown. Edit the name to have it saved with a different name. If multiple files are being
    unzipped, the field displays the first few filenames. Renaming is not allowed when unzipping
    multiple files.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Where to Unzip</b>: select the destination for the unzipped files. The
    drop down displays the standard Mac locations plus a list of recent destinations from previous
    unzip operations. During unzipping, if a file being unzipped has the same name as a file in the
    destination location, a <a href="#Replace">prompt</a> will display requesting an action to
    take.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">What to Unzip</b>: to unzip selected files, click on the <b>Selected
    items</b> button. This button is unavailable if there are no selected files in the open Zip
    file.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Show Results</b>: check <b>Show unzipped files in Finder</b> to have
    WinZip open a Finder window after unzipping showing the folder in which the files were
    unzipped.</li>

    sheet slides down from the WinZip toolbar. You can select the options and destination for
    the unzipped files. Once the options have been set, click <b>Unzip</b> to unzip the files to
    the designated location.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Where to Unzip</b>: select the destination for the unzipped files by selecting or navigating to 
	a destination folder. During unzipping, if a file being unzipped has the same name as a file in the

  <h6><a name="Replace" id="Replace"></a>Replace Existing File Prompt</h6>

  <p>During unzipping, if a file being unzipped has the same name as a file in the destination
  location, the following alert will display requesting an action to take.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Replace.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Possible Actions</b>: when a file already exists in the destination
    location with the same name as the file being unzipped, the available options are
    <b>Replace</b>, to replace the existing file with the one being unzipped, <b>Don't Replace</b>,
    to skip unzipping the file and leave the destination file as is, or <b>Stop</b>, to stop the
    unzipping process. If it is possible that there will be multiple conflicts, check <b>Apply to
    All</b> and the chosen action will be repeated for each conflict encountered during the
    remainder of the unzip operation.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Default Action</b>: the default action is <b>Stop</b>. This ends the
    unzip operation and prevents accidental overwrites if the default action is accidentally
    chosen.</li>
