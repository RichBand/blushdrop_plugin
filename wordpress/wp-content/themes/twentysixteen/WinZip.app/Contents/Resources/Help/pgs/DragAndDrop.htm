  <h1>Using Drag and Drop</h1>Zipping and unzipping files in WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> is as easy as
  dragging and dropping files.

  <h6>Zipping Using Drag and Drop</h6>Zipping files using Drag and Drop can be accomplished in one
  of two ways

  <ul>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Using the Dock Icon</b>: From Finder or the desktop, select the files to be zipped, drag
    and drop them on the WinZip icon on the Dock. See <a href="UsingDockIcon.htm">Using the
    Dock Icon</a> for more details.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Using an Open Zip file</b>: from an <a href="OpenZipFile.htm">open Zip file</a> navigate
    to the location where the zipped files are to be added. From Finder or the desktop, select the
    files to be zipped, drag and drop them inside the WinZip window. The files will be zipped
    using the format that corresponds to the type of Zip file on which the files were dropped. Files cannot 
	be encrypted using this method, use the WinZip icon on the Dock to encrypt the files.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Unzipping Using Drag and Drop</h6>To unzip files using drag and drop, <a href=
  "OpenZipFile.htm">open the Zip file</a> in WinZip. Locate the files to be unzipped. Drag and
  Drop the files from WinZip onto the desktop or into a folder in a Finder window. If the files
  are encrypted, you may be prompted for the <a href=
  "UnZip-SelectedFiles.htm#EncryptedFiles">password</a>.
