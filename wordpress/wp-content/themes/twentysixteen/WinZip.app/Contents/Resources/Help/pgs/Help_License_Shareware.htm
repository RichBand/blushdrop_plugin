  <h2>WinZip License<br>
  Evaluation Version</h2>

  <h3 class="c1">Your Agreement to this License</h3>

  <p>This License only applies to the executable code for the English-language version of the
  WinZip 4 software and any accompanying distributable files, data and materials
  ("WinZip"). You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before
  using, installing, copying, distributing, or transmitting this software. By using, installing,
  copying, distributing, or transmitting WinZip without registering your copy of WinZip, 
  you agree to all of the terms of this evaluation license agreement ("License").
  Refer to www.WinZip.com for information about pricing, multi-user licensing, and registration
  options.</p>

  <p>For registered copies of WinZip the WinZip features you are allowed to
  access will depend on the registration code you have been given based on your licensed version of
  WinZip. Refer to the documentation provided with your license which identifies your
  licensed version of WinZip. For a complete description of the features available with
  each version of WinZip, refer to <a href=
  "http://www.winzip.com/wzgate.cgi?lang=EN&prod=WM&url=www.winzip.com" target=
  "_blank">www.winzip.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Please read the license terms below. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of
  this License, then do not use, install, copy, distribute, or transmit WinZip.</p>

  <h3 class="c1">Scope of License</h3>

  <p>This is not free software. Subject to the terms below, you are hereby licensed by WinZip
  Computing, S.L. ("WinZip Computing") to use for evaluation purposes only one (1) copy of WinZip,
  on one (1) computer or workstation, without charge, for a period of 45 days after
  you first install WinZip on any computer or workstation. If you want to use this
  software after the 45-day evaluation period, you must acquire from WinZip Computing for a fee a
  single-user license or multi-user license for WinZip. Refer to www.winzip.com for
  information about Standard license pricing, multi-user licensing, and ordering options. Use of
  WinZip after the expiration of the 45-day evaluation period without acquiring such a
  license from WinZip Computing is outside the scope of this License and a violation of U.S. and
  international copyright laws.</p>

  <p>Subject to all of the terms of this License, you may, without making any payment to WinZip
  Computing:</p>

  <ol>
    <li type="a">give exact copies of WinZip personally and without charge of any kind
    to anyone for evaluation purposes only, subject to the terms of this License, using tangible
    media of any kind or via e-mail (but not in a bulk mailing or through unsolicited bulk
    e-mails);</li>

    <li type="a">distribute exact copies of WinZip for evaluation purposes only,
    subject to the terms of this License, if done exclusively by allowing downloads through the
    public Internet and without charge of any kind; and</li>

    <li type="a">make as many exact copies of WinZip as you wish, for purposes of
    distribution as described in (a) and (b) above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For purposes of the foregoing, an "exact copy" of WinZip means a file that is
  identical, at the time you create the copy, to the WinZip distribution file available
  at http://www.winzip.com.</p>

  <p class="c2">You are specifically prohibited from charging, or requesting donations, for any
  distributed copies, however made, or from distributing such copies with other products of any
  kind, commercial or otherwise, without prior written permission from WinZip Computing. Also, you
  are specifically prohibited from charging, or requesting donations, for providing access to any
  hyperlink or other method that allows a user to create or transfer electronically copies of
  WinZip.</p>

  <p class="c2">WinZip Computing reserves the right to revoke any or all distribution rights at any
  time, for any or no reason.</p>

  <p>All rights of any kind in WinZip which are not expressly granted in this License
  are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by WinZip Computing. You may use WinZip
  solely as expressly provided in this License. WinZip is protected by the United
  States copyright laws and other applicable national and international laws and treaties. You may
  not rent, lease, sublicense, modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
  create derivative works based on, WinZip, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else
  to do so. You may not make access to WinZip available to others in connection with a
  service bureau, application service provider, or similar business, nor permit anyone else to do
  so. The license granted hereunder includes no rights in or to the source code version of WinZip.</p>

  <p>WinZip includes a user selectable feature to check for software updates. By
  selecting the option to check for updates automatically, or manually invoking the feature, you
  are consenting to allow WinZip Computing to download and install updated non-executable files
  (such as screen files) to your computer without further notice. Before WinZip
  downloads and installs any updated executable files, WinZip will request your express
  consent.</p>

  <h3 class="c1">Warranty Disclaimers and Liability Limitations</h3>

  <p><b><i>WinZip, and any and all accompanying software, files, data and materials,

  implied, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a
  particular purpose. Neither WinZip Computing nor any of its affiliates or licensors warrant,
  guarantee, or make any representations regarding the use of, or the results of the use of, WinZip. Neither WinZip Computing nor any of its affiliates or licensors warrants that the
  operation of WinZip will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that the use of any
  passwords and/or encryption features will be effective in preventing the unintentional disclosure
  of information contained in any file.</i></b> You acknowledge that good data processing procedure
  dictates that any program, including WinZip, must be thoroughly tested with
  non-critical data before there is any reliance on it, and you hereby assume the entire risk of
  all use of the copies of WinZip covered by this License. <b><i>This disclaimer of
  warranty constitutes an essential part of this License.</i></b></p>

  <p class="c2">Except to the extent expressly prohibited by applicable statutes, WinZip Computing,
  its affiliates or licensors shall not be liable for any damage or financial loss arising out of
  the use of, or inability to use, WinZip. Any liability of WinZip Computing, its
  affiliates or licensors will be limited exclusively to refund of any license or registration fee
  paid to WinZip Computing. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by applicable statutes, in no
  event shall WinZip Computing, or its principals, shareholders, officers, employees, affiliates,
  licensors, contractors, subsidiaries, or parent organizations, be liable for any direct,
  indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages whatsoever relating to the use
  of WinZip, or to your relationship with WinZip Computing, its affiliates or licensors
  (including, without limitation, loss or disclosure of data or information, loss of profit,
  revenue, business opportunity or business advantage, or business interruption), whether based
  upon a claim or action of contract, warranty, negligence, strict liability, contribution,

  such damages.</p>

  <p class="c2">In addition, in no event does WinZip Computing authorize you or anyone else to use
  WinZip in applications or systems where WinZip's failure to perform can
  reasonably be expected to result in a significant physical injury, or in loss of property, or
  loss of life. Any such use is entirely at your own risk, and you agree to hold WinZip Computing,
  its affiliates or licensors harmless from any and all claims or losses relating to such
  unauthorized use.</p>

  costs, liabilities and judgments, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and

  inconsistent with any accompanying documentation; (ii) any breach of this License by you; or
  (iii) any violation of applicable law by you, your directors, officers, trustees, shareholders,

  <h3 class="c1">General</h3>

  <p>WinZip, including, without limitation, the information included in its
  accompanying distributable files, data and materials and any related activation code and
  registration code files or information, and the know-how embodied in WinZip, is

  and solely owned or licensed by WinZip Computing, together with all related copyrights and
  trademarks relating thereto. You agree to maintain the Proprietary Information in strictest
  confidence for the benefit of WinZip Computing and its licensors. You shall not sell, license,
  publish, display, distribute, disclose, or otherwise make available or allow to be made available
  the Proprietary Information, including, without limitation, any activation codes or registration
  code files, to any third party nor use such Proprietary Information except as authorized by this
  License. The obligations under this paragraph shall survive any termination or cancellation of
  the License.</p>

  <p>This License is the complete statement of the agreement between the parties on the subject
  matter, and merges and supersedes all other or prior understandings, purchase orders, agreements,
  and arrangements.</p>

  <p>This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to

  <p>There are no third-party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations, or representations made
  by WinZip Computing herein.</p>

  nor contribute to, a waiver by WinZip Computing of any other or future violation by you of the
  same provision, or any other provision, of this License.</p>

  <p>You acknowledge and agree that monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy in the
  event of a material breach by you of your obligations or agreements under this License and that,
  in such event, WinZip Computing or any of its affiliates shall be entitled to injunctive relief
  to require you to comply with its obligations hereunder. Any remedy available under this License
  shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy available WinZip Computing or any of
  its affiliates under this License, at law or in equity.</p>

  any reason held invalid or unenforceable, it shall be deemed severable, and the validity of the
  remainder of this License, or the applications of such provision to other persons or
  circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.</p>
