  <h1>Emailing an Open Zip File</h1>

  <div class="resize">
    <p>To email files from within WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>, first <a href=
    "AddToZipFile.htm">add</a> them to an open Zip file and then email the Zip file. To email the
    open Zip file, click on the <b>Email as attachment</b> icon on the <a href="Tool%20Bar.htm">toolbar</a> or
    click on <b>Email as attachment</b> from the <a href="Menu%20Bar%20-%20Actions.htm">Actions</a> menu. The following sheet will display:</p>
<br>
    <p><img src="../gfx/Email.png"  alt=""></p>
<br>
    <ol>
      <li><b class="Bullet">Picture Size</b>: If the Zip or Zipx file contains images, this sheet appears
      when you click on the Email icon or menu item. The sheet offers the
      option to resize pictures in the Zip file attached to the message. When the Zip file includes
      pictures, additional space savings can be obtained by reducing the picture size. Using this
      feature does not alter the size of the originals in the Zip file. Only pictures stored in a
      temporary copy of the Zip file to be attached to the email message are resized. Pictures are only
      reduced, never enlarged. The aspect ratio, the ratio of the width to the height of the picture, is also
      maintained. The choices for size are <b>Actual Size</b> (the image size is not changed),
      <b>Smaller</b> (the picture is reduced to fit in an area 640 x 480 pixels), <b>Small</b> (the
      picture is reduced to fit in an area 800 x 600 pixels), <b>Medium</b> (the picture is reduced
      to fit in an area 1024 x 768 pixels), and <b>Large</b> (the picture is reduced to fit in an area
      1280 x 1024 pixels).</li>

     <p>Once the desired option is selected, click on <b>Compose Message</b>.</p>
    </ol>

    <p>The Zip file will be attached to a new message. Simply, finish the message and send it.</p>
