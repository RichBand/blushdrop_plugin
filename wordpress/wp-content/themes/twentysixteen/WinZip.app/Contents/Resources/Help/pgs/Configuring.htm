  <h1>Configuring WinZip</h1>

  <p>The Preferences window lets you configure the default behavior of WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>. You
  can access the Preferences window by clicking on <b>Preferences</b> from the <a href=
  "Menu%20Bar%20-%20WinZip.htm">WinZip</a> menu.</p>

  <p>The Preference window has three sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#General">General</a></li>

    <li><a href="#Types">File Types</a></li>
	
	<li><a href="#CloudService">Cloud Service</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h6><a name="General" id="General"></a>General</h6>

  <p>The General pane of the Preferences window displays all the current default preference
  settings for WinZip and allows the defaults to be changed.</p>

  <ol>
    <li class="AutoOpen"><b class="Bullet">Automatic Open</b>: if this option is checked, when opening a Zip file that contains
    only one file in it, WinZip will unzip the file and open it in its associated program. This
    only happens if WinZip considers the kind of file to be safe, such as iWork and Microsoft Office
    files.</li>

	<li><b class="Bullet">Smart View Selection</b>: If this option is checked, WinZip will default to the Icon view if the Zip file contains images. If the option is unchecked, WinZip will use the last view used.</li>
	
    <li><b class="Bullet">Updates</b>: if this option is checked, WinZip will check for updates weekly. If an
    update is found, a "<a href="Notification%20Screen.htm">notification</a>" screen is
    displayed.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Include</b>: if this option is checked, WinZip will zip hidden files when zipping
    folders that contain hidden files.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">New file location</b>: specifies the default location where new files are saved.</li>

    <li>
      <b class="Bullet">Default Format</b>: specifies the compression format to use when creating
      or adding to a Zip file. The choices are Zip (compatibility), Zipx (best compression), and
      LHA.

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <i>Zip (compatibility)</i>

          <p>The <i>Zip</i> option uses a traditional data compression algorithm, known as
          'deflate', that is supported by all versions of WinZip and virtually all other Zip
          file utilities. The 'deflate' method is generally considered to be a good all-purpose
          compression algorithm for most types of files. <i>Zip</i> is your best choice when sharing a Zip
          file and the recipient's Zip utility is unknown, or known to use older technology. <i>Zip</i>
          compression creates a Zip file with the extension '.zip'.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Zipx (best compression)</i>

          <p>The <i>Zipx</i> option allows WinZip to choose the best compression method for
          each file, based on the kind of file. You may want to choose this option if compressed
          file size is a primary concern. If sharing the Zip file, be sure that recipients of the
          Zip file are using WinZip (Mac), WinZip 12.0 (or later) (Windows), or another Zip file
          utility that is compatible with all of WinZip's compression methods. By default, best
          method compression creates a Zip file with the extension '.zipx'.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>LHA</i>

          <p>The <i>LHA</i> option uses the LHA compression method. Although not used much in the
          West, LHA remains popular in Japan. By default, LHA compression creates an LHA file with
          the extension '.lha'.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b class="Bullet">Encryption Method</b>: specifies the encryption method to use when the
      encryption option is selected during the Zipping operation. Encryption is only supported for
      Zip and Zipx compression methods. The choices are AES 128-bit, AES 256-bit, and ZIP 2.0.

      <ul type="disc">

        <li>
          <i>AES 128-bit (recommended)</i>

          <p>The <i>AES 128-bit</i> option uses AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, which is the
          result of a three-year competition sponsored by the U.S. Government's National Institute
          of Standards (NIST). This encryption method, also known as Rijndael, has been adopted by
          NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard. AES 128 refers to the size of the
          encryption keys that are used to encrypt the data. AES 128 can provide significantly
          greater security than the standard Zip 2.0 method described below. An advantage of
          128-bit AES is that it is slightly faster than 256-bit AES, that is, it takes less time
          to encrypt or decrypt a file. If sharing the Zip file, be sure that recipients of the Zip
          file are using WinZip (Mac), WinZip 9.0 (or later) (Windows), or another Zip file utility
          that is compatible with WinZip's AES encryption methods.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>AES 256-bit (higher security)</i>

          <p>The <i>AES 256-bit</i> option uses AES but with 256-bit encryption keys that are used to
          encrypt the data. AES 256-bit is stronger than AES 128-bit, but both of them can provide
          significantly greater security than the standard Zip 2.0 method described below. If
          sharing the Zip file, be sure that recipients of the Zip file are using WinZip (Mac), 
		  WinZip 9.0 (or later) (Windows), or another Zip file utility that is compatible with
          WinZip's AES encryption methods.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>ZIP 2.0 (compatibility)</i>

          <p>The <i>Zip 2.0</i> option uses an older encryption technique that provides a measure
          of protection against casual users who do not have the password and are trying to
          determine the contents of the files. However, the Zip 2.0 encryption format is known to
          be relatively weak and cannot be expected to provide protection from individuals with
          access to specialized password recovery tools. The advantage of Zip 2.0 encryption over
          the more secure AES encryption is that it is supported by most Zip file utilities,
          including earlier versions of WinZip. Files that you encrypt using this technique can
          be unzipped by anyone who knows the correct password and has access to almost any Zip
          file utility.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b class="Bullet">Replace existing items when Unzipping</b>: this option specifies what WinZip should
      do when you unzip items from a Zip file and items with the same name already exist in the
      destination location. The options are "Ask me what to do", "Replace the existing item",
      and "Keep the existing item".

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <i>Ask me what to do</i>

          <p>The <i>Ask me what to do</i> option results in a prompt whenever a file exists in the
          destination that has the same name as a file being unzipped. The prompt provides the
          choice to replace the existing file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Replace the existing item</i>

          <p>The <i>Replace the existing item</i> option replaces the existing item in the destination
          with the item being unzipped that has the same name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Keep the existing item</i>

          <p>The <i>Keep the existing item</i> option leaves the existing item in the
          destination as is. The item is not replaced and unzipping of the item with the same name
          is skipped.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h6><a name="Types" id="Types"></a>File Types</h6>

  <p>The File Types pane of the Preferences window displays all the kinds of files that can be
  associated with WinZip by default and allows the defaults to be changed.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Preferences%20-%20File%20Type.png"  alt=""></p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">File Types</b>: WinZip displays a list of supported file types. By
    default, WinZip will set all of these file types to open in WinZip when they are
    double-clicked from Finder, Mail, etc.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Associated Programs</b>: A drop down menu for each file type lists WinZip
    Mac and any other programs that can open that file type. Select the program that you want to
    use to open files of that type by default.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h6><a name="CloudService" id="CloudService"></a>Cloud Service</h6>
   <p>The Cloud Service pane of the Preferences window displays the cloud storage services available in WinZip. One can 
   Login and Log out of a cloud service or set a default cloud service from this pane also.</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Preferences%20-%20Cloud%20Service.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Cloud Service Name</b>: WinZip supports these cloud storage services: ZipShare, Google Drive, and Dropbox.</li>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Status</b>: Displays the space usage of the cloud storage service when logged into the corresponding cloud storage service.</li>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Login/Log out</b>: Use this section to Login to and Log out of the corresponding cloud storage service.</li>
