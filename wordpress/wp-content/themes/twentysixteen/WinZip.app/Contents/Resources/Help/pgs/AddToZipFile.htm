  <h1>Adding files to an open Zip file (Zipping)</h1>To zip files from within WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>,
  add them to an open Zip file. A Zip file is open if you <a href="CreateZipFile.htm">created the
  Zip file</a> or <a href="OpenZipFile.htm">opened the Zip file</a> using WinZip. To add files
  to the open Zip file, click on the <b>Add from My Mac</b> or <b>Add from Cloud</b> icons on the <a href="Tool%20Bar.htm">toolbar</a> or
  click on <b>Add from My Mac</b> or <b>Add from Cloud</b> from the <a href="Menu%20Bar%20-%20Actions.htm">Actions</a> menu. The
  following sheet will display:

  <h6><a name="AddFromMyMac" id="AddFromMyMac"></a>Add from My Mac</h6>
  <p><img src="../gfx/Add.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Add Sheet</b>: When the <b>Add from My Mac</b> icon or menu item is selected, the Add sheet slides down
    from the WinZip toolbar. You can then select files and folders to be added to the open Zip
    file. Once the selection has been made, click <b>Zip</b> to add the files to the Open Zip
    file</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">File/Folder Selection</b>: The upper half of the Add sheet contains the standard Mac
    Open dialog box fields allowing navigation through devices, places, and folders and the
    selection of files and folders.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Add Options</b>: The lower half of the Add sheet contains the Add option for encrypting
    the files being zipped. Check the <b>Encrypt</b> box and enter the password and re-enter the password
    for spelling verification. The encryption method used is based on the setting in the <a href=
    "Configuring.htm">Preferences</a>.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Add Sheet</b>: When the <b>Add from Cloud</b> icon or menu item is selected, the Add sheet slides down
    from the WinZip toolbar. You can then select files and folders to be added to the open Zip
    file. Once the selection has been made, click <b>Zip</b> to add the files to the Open Zip
    file</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Add Options</b>: The lower half of the Add sheet contains the Add option for encrypting
    the files being zipped. Check the <b>Encrypt</b> box and enter the password and re-enter the password
    for spelling verification. The encryption method used is based on the setting in the <a href=

  </ol>
  <p><b><i>Note</i></b>: the type of compression used when zipping files depends on the kind of Zip file to which
  the files are being added. For example, files with a .zip extension use Zip (compatibility) while
  files with a .zipx extension use Zipx (best compression).</p>
