  <h1>Quick Look (Previewing an entire Zip file)</h1>WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> expands the Finder's Quick
  Look by adding support for previewing the content of your Zip file. Select a Zip file in the
  Finder and press the <b>Space bar</b> or click the <b>Quick Look</b> icon in the Finder window. A transparent
  window appears, showing you the contents of the Zip file instantly. The Quick Look window for a
  Zip file looks like the following:
