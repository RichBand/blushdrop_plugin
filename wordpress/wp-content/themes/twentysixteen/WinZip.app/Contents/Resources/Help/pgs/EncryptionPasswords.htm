  <h1>Encryption Passwords</h1><i>The encryption facility provided by this version of WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>
  is identical to the AES encryption provided by the Windows version of WinZip 9 or later.</i>

  <p>The security of your data depends not only on the strength of the encryption method but also
  on the strength of your password, including factors such as length and composition of the
  password, and the measures you take to ensure that your password is not disclosed to unauthorized
  third parties.</p>

  <p>You should keep the following considerations in mind when choosing passwords for your
  files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In general, longer passwords are more secure than shorter passwords. In fact, taking
    maximum advantage of the full strength of AES encryption requires a password of approximately
    32 characters for 128-bit encryption and 64 characters for 256-bit encryption.</li>

    <li>Passwords that contain a mixture of letters (upper and lower case), digits, and punctuation
    are more secure than passwords containing only letters.</li>

    <li>Because you can use spaces and punctuation, you can create "pass phrases" that are long
    enough but still easy to remember and type.</li>

    <li>Avoid using easily guessed passwords such as names, birthdays, Social Security numbers,
    addresses, telephone numbers, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Be sure to keep a record of the passwords you use and to keep this record in a secure place.
  WinZip has no way to access the contents of an encrypted file unless you supply the correct
  password. Before storing your only copies of critical information in encrypted form, you should
  carefully consider the risks associated with losing or forgetting the passwords involved.</p>
