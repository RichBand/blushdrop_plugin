  <h1>Saving a Zip file</h1>To save a Zip file from within WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>,
  you need to have a Zip file open. To save a Zip file, 
  click on <b>Save</b> from the <a href="Menu%20Bar%20-%20File.htm">File</a> menu and select a location from 
  the drop down menu. The following sheet will display:

	from the WinZip toolbar. You can then select the folder location where to save the open Zip 
	file. Once the selection has been made, click <b>Save</b> to save the file to the selected folder.</li>

	<li><b class="Bullet">Save As File Name</b>: the top of the Save sheet contains a textbox to type the file name to save the Zip file.
