  <h1>About Zip Files</h1>

  <h6>What is a Zip File?</h6>

  <p>Zip files are files that contain other files. Typically the files in a Zip file are
  compressed. Zip files usually have file names ending with ZIP, ZIPX, LZH, LHA, RAR or 7Z,
  depending on how they were created. Zip files make it easy to group files and make transporting
  and copying these files faster.</p>

  <h3>Typical Uses for Zip files:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Most files available on the Internet are distributed as Zip files. Two benefits of using
    Zip files for electronic file distribution are that only one file transfer operation
    ("download") is required to obtain all related files and file transfer time is minimized
    because the files in a Zip file are compressed.</li>

    <li>It is often necessary to send a group of related files to an associate. Rather than
    distributing individual files, it is often easier to distribute the files as a Zip file to
    benefit from the file grouping and compression.</li>

    <li>Some files are important but not used often. To save disk space simply zip these files into
    a Zip file when they are not used and unzip them only when needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Zip file formats:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Zip and Zipx files are the most common Zip file format. Zip files can span multiple disks
    and provide both compression and file grouping. Zip files created by WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> can have a
    <i>.zip</i> or <i>.zipx</i> file extension.</li>

    <li>LZH and LHA are older file formats that provide both grouping and compression, like Zip
    files.</li>

    <li>RAR is a compression and archiving format. The compression technology is proprietary
    however the decompression technology is not. WinZip does not create .rar files, but WinZip
    can view and unzip the contents of .rar files.</li>

    <li>7Z is a compression and archiving format. The compression technology is proprietary;
    however, the decompression technology is publicly available under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License. WinZip does not create .7z files, but WinZip can view and unzip the contents
    of .7z files.</li>
  </ul>
