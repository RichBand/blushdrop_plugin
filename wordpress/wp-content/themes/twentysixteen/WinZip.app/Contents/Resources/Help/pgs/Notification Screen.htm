  <h1>Updates and Notifications</h1>WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup> will check for updates and notifications
  approximately once a day (depending on how often you run WinZip). This feature can be turned
  off or on in the <a href="Configuring.htm">Preferences</a> dialog box. If a notification is
  available, a window will display with information and directions on how to download the update.

  <h3>Notes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The time periods of once a day or week is approximate because WinZip only checks for an
    update when it is run. Therefore, if you do not run WinZip daily or weekly, it will not check
    daily or weekly. However, it will do so the next time you run it after the specified
    duration.</li>

    <li>WinZip does not transmit any personally identifiable information during the Check for
    Notifications process. For WinZip privacy information, please see the <a href=
    "http://www.winzip.com/wzgate.cgi?lang=EN&prod=WM&url=www.winzip.com/privacy.htm" target=
