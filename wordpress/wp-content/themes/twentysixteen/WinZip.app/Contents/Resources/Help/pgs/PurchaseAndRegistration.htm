  <p>WinZip is not free software. Subject to the terms of the WinZip <a href=
  "Help_License_Shareware.htm">Evaluation License</a>, you are licensed by WinZip Computing, S.L.
  ("WinZip Computing") to use for evaluation purposes only one (1) copy of WinZip, on
  one (1) computer or workstation, without charge, for a period of 45 days after you first install
  WinZip on any computer or workstation, during which period the features of the
  WinZip software will be accessible. If you want to use this software after the 45-day
  evaluation period, you must acquire from WinZip Computing for a fee a single-user license for
  WinZip. Refer to <a href=
  "http://www.winzip.com/wzgate.cgi?lang=EN&prod=WM&url=www.winzip.com/order.htm" target="_blank">Ordering
  Information</a> for information on license pricing and ordering options. Use of WinZip
  after the expiration of the 45-day evaluation period without acquiring such a license from WinZip
  Computing is outside the scope of the Evaluation License and a violation of U.S. and
  international copyright laws.</p>

 ?</h6>

  <h3><a name="WZsreg" id="WZsreg"></a>With a registration code</h3>

  <p>License owners who have been issued a registration code can convert the evaluation version of
  WinZip to a registered version as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Install and run WinZip.</li>

    <li>The "Thank you for trying WinZip" dialog box will appear.

      <p><img src="../gfx/ThankYouScreen.png"  alt=""></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Enter your name and registration code EXACTLY as they appear on your registration
        acknowledgment email or on the WinZip CD case and click
        <b>Register</b>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="WZsact" id="WZsact"></a>With an activation code</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>If your WinZip license was not purchased directly from WinZip but instead from
    an authorized reseller, you will have been issued an activation code rather than a registration
    code. In this case, the procedure for registering begins in the same way as that explained in
    <a href="#WZsreg">With a registration code</a>.</li>

    <li class="Continue"><strong>Note</strong>: activation requires an active Internet connection.
    If you are not already connected when you click the <b>OK</b> button, WinZip will initiate
    your default connection before completing the activation process.</li>

    <li>After your name and activation code have been entered in the "Thank you for trying WinZip
    Mac" dialog box as described above, click <b>Register</b>.

      <ol>
        <li>You are now presented with the WinZip Activation Information screen. Fill
        in the requested information and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

        <li>WinZip will verify the activation code, issue a registration code based upon the name
        or e-mail address you entered, and enter the registration code into WinZip
        automatically.</li>

        <li>A confirmation e-mail, containing the registration information, will also be sent to
        the e-mail address entered.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
