  <h1>Using the Dock Icon</h1>
  
  <p>The quickest way to zip or unzip files is to drag them to the WinZip<sup>&reg;</sup>
  icon on the Dock.

  <h6>Putting WinZip on the Dock</h6>
  
  <p>To be able to drag files to the WinZip icon at any
  time, it needs to be placed on the Dock. The first time you run WinZip, the icon may be installed on thebDock for you automatically. If you did not install the icon on the Dock during the first use of WinZip, do the following: first, drag the WinZip application (WinZip.app application bundle) to your Applications folder if it has not already been done. Then drag it from the Applications folder to the Dock.

  <h6>Opening a Zip file with the Dock Icon</h6>

  <p>To open a Zip file, drag it from your desktop or Finder window and drop it on the WinZip
  icon on the Dock. The Zip file will be opened in WinZip.</p>

  <h6>Creating a New Zip file with the Dock Icon</h6>

  <p>To zip your files into a new Zip file, drag the files from the desktop or Finder window and
  drop them on the WinZip icon on the Dock. The following window appears:</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Dock%20Icon%20-%20New%20Zip.png"  alt=""></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Select the Operation</b>: if the <b>Create new Zip file</b> pane is not
    selected, click on the tab.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Choose a Destination</b>: select the folder where the Zip file is to be
    created.

    <p>You may have a <b>Where</b> field with a dropdown list of folders instead of the folder pane shown in the
    screenshot.  To show the folder pane instead, click on the arrow button next to the <b>Save As</b>
    field (highlighted by number 3 in the screenshot above).</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Save As</b>: enter the name for your Zip file.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet"><a name="Format" id="Format">Pick a Format</a></b>: the default format is
    based on the setting in <a href="Configuring.htm">Preferences</a>. You can choose <b>Zip (Compatibility)</b>
    to create a Zip file compatible with the legacy Zip 2.0 specifications. You can also choose <b>Zipx Best compression)</b> to create the smallest possible compressed file (requires WinZip (Mac), WinZip 12.1 or greater (Windows), or a Zipx compatible compression utility). Another option is the ability to create an LHA file.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet"><a name="Encrypt" id="Encrypt">Encrypt</a></b>: if you would like to have
    the Zip file encrypted, check the <b>Encrypt</b> box and specify a password. Enter the password
    a second time to verify that there are no typos. The file will be encrypted using the
    encryption method specified in <a href="Configuring.htm">Preferences</a>. This option is
    ignored if you choose LHA as the file format.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Click on the <b>Zip</b> button to create the Zip file, zip the dropped files/folders, and add them to
  the new Zip file.</p>

  <h6>Adding to an Open or Recently Opened Zip file with the Dock Icon</h6>

  <p>To zip your files into an open or recently opened Zip file, drag the files from the desktop or
  Finder window and drop them on the WinZip icon on the dock. The following window
  appears:</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Dock%20Icon%20-%20Existing%20Zip.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>If the <b>Add to existing Zip file</b> pane is not selected, click on the tab to select
  it.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Choose Currently Open or Recently Opened</b>: when no Zip files are
    currently open, the default is to list the most recently used Zip files. If you already have
    one or more Zip files open, the default is to list the open Zip files. If you have Zip files
    open but want to add the dropped files into a recently opened Zip file, click on the
    <b>Recently Opened</b> button to see the list of recently opened Zip files. Click on
    <b>Currently Open</b> to go back to the list of open Zip files.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Select the Zip file</b>: click on the Zip file into which you want to
    zip the dropped files.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet"><a name="Encrypt" id="Encrypt">Encrypt</a></b>: if you would like to have
    the Zip file encrypted, check the <b>Encrypt</b> box and specify a password. Enter the password
    a second time to verify that there are no typos. The file will be encrypted using the
    encryption method specified in <a href="Configuring.htm">Preferences</a>. This option is
    ignored if you chose an LHA file for the destination.</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Zip the files</b>: click on the <b>Zip</b> button to open the selected
    Zip file (if it isn't already open), zip the dropped files/folders, and add them to the Zip
    file. If the Zip file selected is an open Zip file, the results will be added to the current
    folder selected in the open Zip file. If the selected Zip file is a recently opened Zip file,
    the files are added to the main folder of the Zip file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h6><a name="DockZipEmail" id="DockZipEmail"></a>Zip and Emailing with the Dock Icon</h6>

  <p>To zip your files and create a new email message with the Zip file attached, drag the files
  from the desktop or Finder window and drop them on the WinZip icon on the dock. The following
  window box appears:</p>

  <p><img src="../gfx/Dock%20Icon%20-%20Zip%20And%20EMail.png"  alt=""></p>

  <p>If the <b>Zip and Email</b> pane is not selected, click on the tab to select it.</p>

  <p>The <a href="#Format">Format</a> and <a href="#Encrypt">Encrypt</a> choices are the same as
  for creating a new Zip file using the Dock icon.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b class="Bullet">Picture Size</b>:  if the Zip file includes pictures, additional space
      savings can be obtained by reducing the picture size. Using this feature does not alter
      the size of the original pictures in the Zip file. Only copies stored in a temporary copy of the Zip file to
      be attached to the email message are resized. Pictures are only reduced, never enlarged. The
      aspect ratio, the ratio of the width to the height of the picture, is also
      maintained. The choices for size are <b>Actual Size</b> (the image size is not changed),
      <b>Smaller</b> (the picture is reduced to fit in an area 640 x 480 pixels), <b>Small</b> (the
      picture is reduced to fit in an area 800 x 600 pixels), <b>Medium</b> (the picture is reduced
      to fit in an area 1024 x 768 pixels), <b>Large</b> (the picture is reduced to fit in an area
      1280 x 1024 pixels).</li>

    <li><b class="Bullet">Compose Message</b>: click on the <b>Compose Message</b> button to create
    a temporary Zip file, zip the dropped files/folders, and add them to the Zip file. A new
    message is created using Apple Mail with the Zip file attached. After the email is sent, saved,
    or canceled, the temporary Zip file is erased.</li>
